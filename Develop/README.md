  ## Description
   
The purpose of this project was to create a command line application using the inquirer package that accepts user input. Criteria includes:

* When the user runs the application and enters their responses then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
* When a title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions are entered this will be added to appropriate sections of the README
* When a licence is chosen then the corresponding badge is added to the top and the licence section is generated that explains which license the application is covered under 
* The README displays entered GitHub name and a link to the GitHub profile within a Questions sections
* When an email is entered then this is added to the same Questions section, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions 
* When the links in the Table of Contents section are clicked then it takes me to the corresponding section of the README
